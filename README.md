# Combustion Project
This repository contains the term assignment for Fundamentals of Combustion and Systems course.

##### It is required to calculate:
- the adiabatic flame temperature
- products' composition

for butane–air mixture at 1 atm pressure, with initial temperature of __298.15 K__ and __φ = 0.9__

#### Φ C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> + 6.5 ( O<sub>2</sub> + 3.76 N<sub>2</sub>) → a CO<sub>2</sub> + b CO + d <sub>H</sub>2O + e H<sub>2</sub> + f O<sub>2</sub> + g N<sub>2</sub>


#### The following files will be provided:
- [x] __my_package.py__: contains defined functions, imported required modules, and gases properties as a dataframe 
- [x] __Combustion Project__: uses functions and data from *my_package.py* to calculate the adiabatic flame temperature and the products' composition through iterations
- [ ] __Report__: contain assignment overview and details steps taken to reach the solution
